# Crypto-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM-Neural-Network-and-Flask-API
This project predicts cryptocurrency prices using an LSTM neural network and Flask API. It fetches daily data from Alpha Vantage, processes it for model training, and provides predictions via a web interface. The code is adaptable for different cryptocurrencies and markets by changing the symbol and market parameters.

To use it: -Obtain a free API key from Alpha Vantage. -Integrate the API key into your code. -Customize the symbol (e.g., BTC, ETH) by modifying the symbol variable. Similarly, adjust the market variable as needed. -Once you've set everything up, run main.py. -Make a POST request to your Flask application (I use Postman) with the desired date .
